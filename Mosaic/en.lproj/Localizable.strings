Otherwise the application may not be able to synthesize pictures or crash. \n3.If you select smaller grid and larger size before synthesis,the synthesized mosaic photo will be sharper and take longer. \n4.Selected photos should have high definition ,and more photos the album collects, better the mosaic photo is.";
